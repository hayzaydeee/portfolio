        <h2>my web development experience</h2>
        <p>
          I have a good amount of experience with web development, having first
          learnt the basics via a Udemy course in 2019. I haven’t done too much
          work with it though, so this module and the assignment have helped me
          to deepen my knowledge and improve my understanding. Using HTML was
          fairly easy - it’s never been the hardest thing anyways, so defining
          the structure of my site & its different parts wasn’t too difficult. I
          did find myself having to refactor constantly, since the specification
          requires that we use semantic tags where appropriate; I got into the
          habit of using divs and spans for loads of content, which aren’t ideal
          I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first few weeks were spent mastering HTML structure and semantic
          elements. I struggled initially with properly organizing content and
          creating a logical document flow. After numerous iterations and
          feedback, I began to understand the importance of clean, accessible
          markup for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS was a big struggle though. The responsive designs were hard to
          implement. I spent hours debugging layout issues, wrestling with the
          box model and flexbox. The hamburger menu implementation was kind of
          difficult for me, since I was using a vertical navbar rather than the
          horizontal one, which is ideal. I assume we went through exhaustive
          techniques in the lectures, but I didn't have the best attendance
          within these first 6 weeks so naturally i struggled. Anyways I got the
          hang of everything and got my site looking decent.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the hardest parts was trying to add a theme toggle. Making a
          color scheme that worked in both light and dark mode was tricky and
          involved a lot of planning with CSS variables. I made some progress
          but ended up scrapping it because it was too much to handle at the
          time, so it's not in the final site.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yeah overall i enjoyed this project, and I’m looking forward to
          the game we’re building for the final assignment.

        <h2>module reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This module has helped deepen my understanding of web development. I
          do have previous experience with making websites, but it's helped me
          gain an appreciation for web standards, accessibility concerns, and
          user experience design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web technologies evolve rapidly, and this module equipped me with
          research skills and problem-solving methods that will serve me well
          beyond the specific technologies covered. Whilst searching for
          solutions and fixes, I discovered the importance of community
          resources like MDN Web Docs, Stack Overflow, and various CSS blogs
          that have become essential references. I've also used GenAI models
          like ChatGPT to help me understand some concepts better, brainstorm
          features, and suggest solutions to some of the problems I faced.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also tried to get involved in group discussions with my mates, which
          were insightful, exposing me to alternative approaches and
          perspectives I wouldn't have considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The module's emphasis on both technical skills and design principles
          thus far, has helped me gain a good understanding of frontend web
          development. I look forward to the lessons this module still has to
          offer, especially those on JavaScript.

        <h2>design decisions</h2>
        <h3>color scheme</h3>
        <p>
          I chose a gradient-based color scheme with teal as the primary accent
          color because it conveys creativity and professionalism. The color
          combinations were inspired by Sean Halpin's portfolio, because i like
          how he uses different shades of green throughout the site. Per the
          variables.css file, i selected my primary color as #64ffda, and then
          my secondary color as #087e8b. The site's background is a gradient of
          3 colors, with a slight animation to it. The colors are #00487c,
          #087E8B, and #032b43
        </p>
        <h3>typography</h3>
        <p>
          I selected Poppins as the main font for its excellent readability and
          modern feel. For headings and accents, I used Preahvihear to add
          personality while maintaining a clean, professional appearance.
          There's no major reason for choosing these fonts, i just like how they
          look and feel.
        </p>

        <h3>layout & UI elements</h3>
        <p>
          The sidebar navigation was just a unique way to display the navigation
          links, i wanted to try something different from the usual top
          navigation bar. I tried to use a lot of white space to make the
          content more readable and the site more visually appealing. I also
          decided not to use capital letters for most of my headers & titles; i
          think it makes the site look more modern and feel a little less
          formal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the projects showcase, I drew inspiration from Behance's gallery
          layout, implementing a responsive grid to accommodate various screen
          sizes. I also added hover effects to provide visual feedback and make
          the projects feel interactive.
